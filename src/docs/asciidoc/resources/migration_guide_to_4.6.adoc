= Migration Guide from release 4.5.X to release 4.6.0

== Deprecated `toNotify` field

The card field `toNotify` is deprecated. You should use the `actions` field including "STORE_ONLY_IN_ARCHIVES" action instead.

== New line added between opfab fields and template in usercard form

A new line (<br/>) has been added in the usercard form, between the opfab fields (service/process/state or severity or
dates fields (depending on which fields are visible or not)) and the display of the template. So you have to check that
the display of your usercard form still suits you.

== Timeline domain TR renamed RT

To be consistent, the timeline domain TR has been renamed RT (Real Time).
So if necessary, you have to update your config file `web-ui.json`, replacing value `TR` with `RT` in the field
`feed.timeline.domains`, for example :
----
 "timeline": {
   "domains": [
     "RT",
     "J",
     "7D",
     "W",
     "M",
     "Y"
   ]
 }
----

== UI archives and logging number of lines per page
Since it is now possible to select the number of lines per page displayed in the archive and logging screens, the configuration parameters `archive.filters.page.size` and `logging.filters.page.size` are no longer needed and can be removed from the web-ui.json file.

== Configuration for recap email

The feature to send weekly recapitulation email has been added and thus the configuration of operatorfabric.cardsExternalDiffusion has changed. 
Before, this was the default configuration for the daily email :

```
  dailyEmailTitle: 'Cards received during the day'
  hourToSendDailyEmail: 7
  minuteToSendDailyEmail: 30
```

Now the following fields have been added :

  - dailyEmailBodyPrefix
  - weeklyEmailBodyPrefix
  - weeklyEmailTitle
  - dayOfWeekToSendWeeklyRecapEmail

And the time fields have changed from :

  - hourToSendDailyEmail
  - minuteToSendDailyEmail

to :

  - hourToSendRecapEmail
  - minuteToSendRecapEmail

The new default configuration is as such :
```
  dailyEmailTitle: 'Cards received during the day'
  weeklyEmailTitle: 'Cards received during the week'
  dailyEmailBodyPrefix: 'You received the following cards during the past 24 hours : '
  weeklyEmailBodyPrefix: 'You received the following cards during the past 7 days : '
  dayOfWeekToSendWeeklyRecapEmail: 1
  hourToSendRecapEmail: 7
  minuteToSendRecapEmail: 30
```

== Timezone

For the cards-external-diffusion service, the timezone configuration has been moved from the Dockerfile to the docker-compose.yml file. If nothing is set in the docker compose file, the default value will be the local timezone of your machine.
